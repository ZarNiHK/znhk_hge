        <p>Rather of targeting the wristband like every other device, Moov's newest tracker takes a risk. It's a small, black headband that records your heart rate throughout exercises.Due to the obvious increased cardiac output and thin skin, wearing the tracker at the lobes of the head makes it simpler to detect the heart rate. There is a little silicone casing inside the band that houses the sensor. After you've secured the headband, launch the Moov app and select your workout.</p>

    <h5><b>Mpower Wearable Pod</b></h5>
    <img src="images/pod.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="pod">
    <p>Strengthening your physique and creating muscles on your own is a difficult task since you must keep records of every intimate detail, which you may not be able to accomplish all by yourself. That's where Mpower comes into play. The innovative sporting gear is a modest 23-gram pod that may be connected to your muscles to monitor muscular strength. The pod monitors the EMG electrical impulses created by the muscles during workouts using surface EMG technology, and the data is delivered to a linked smartphone app. It offers data on muscular exhaustion, maximal muscle activation power, and rapid muscle fiber activation levels, among other things.</p>
    <h5><b>Garmin Forerunner 245 Music</b></h5>
    <img src="images/watch.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="watch">
    <p>As with almost other Garmin watches, there is indeed a specialized treadmill mode that you can calibrate to ensure you obtain accurate data for your workouts. We could go with the Forerunner 45 or the 945, but the 245 is a good option for treadmill runs. The heart rate monitor performs admirably in terms of accuracy, and you can always supplement it with an additional heart monitor or a footpod as Stryd.</p>
