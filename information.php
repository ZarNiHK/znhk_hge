        <h3>Understand the various gym equipment</h3>
        <p>Before purchasing exercise equipment, you should be familiar with the various varieties and their applications. Knowing the different types can help you choose which ones you need. Aerobic health machines and physical fitness machines are the two main types of equipment. Stationary bicycles, treadmills, rowing machines, and other cardio devices are examples. Strength machines include barbells, dumbbells, mechanized shoulder presses, and leg presses. While a gymnasium may need all of these commercial fitness machines, since you're a person looking to keep healthy, you may buy domestic fitness machines that meet your needs. For example, if your aim is to gain muscle mass, you can concentrate on strength equipment while purchasing basic cardio devices such as a bike.</p>

      <h3>Technology that is wearable</h3>

      <p class>This has reclaimed the number one slot, since it accomplished in 2019 and 2020. Wellness or fitness trackers, smart watches, heart monitors, and GPS (Global Positioning System) monitoring devices, among others, can be used to compute steps and measure pulse rate, temperature, nutrients, free time, and sleep time. Measurements of hypertension, oxygen levels, and breathing rate, as well as an electrocardiogram, are among the new developments (ECG). It provides the best measurements possible, however they may not be completely exact.</p>

        <h3>Year of Home Exercises</h3>
        <p>
        This is the first year when home workout gyms have become a fitness craze. In these uncertain times, many households have sprung makeshift gyms as a substitute to going to the gym. It's safer, and you have more freedom in arranging your workouts. Gym bunnies are predicted to continue isolating themselves by remaining at home and utilizing the abundance of gear available for purchase online, including treadmills, stationary cycles, steppers, dumbbells, and exercise puck.

      <h3>Outdoor Activities</h3>
      <p>People all across the world have turned to outdoor activities like jogging, running, climbing, and biking to reap the benefits of the clean air and improved circulation. Even if you do not use face masks, you are much less exposed to the Sars outbreak if you keep 6 feet apart outside. Outdoor activities were rated fourth last year (2021). Personal trainers are also taking their customers to neighborhood parks and fields to get them in shape. The only disadvantage is that if it rains, you'll have to return indoors.</p>

          Virtual Reality Fitness
        </h3>
        <p>
        The expected development of virtual reality (Virtual - reality) fitness about as distant from cherished childhood hobbies as you can get is at the other extreme of the spectrum. VR has quietly but steadily made its presence felt in the fitness business, but technology has historically been prohibitively expensive and unavailable to the common individual. That may be changing right now. Not only are standard fitness applications becoming popular (though VR activities like boxing and skiing are), but we're also witnessing the growth of VR apps that turn your workout into something exciting, with loads of difficulties and experiences along the route.
